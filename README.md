# ICS-security-profile-using-Shodan-API
In this project, I used Python API to retrieve search results from Shodan, analyzed it in order to make a profile of the vulnerabilities hidden in the ICS (Industrial Control System) protocols and devices.

You need to input a valid Shodan key (corresponding to your Shodan account) to finish running the program. You can also check the data I retrieved (in certain style based on my code), but due to time manner, the result may be out-dated.

For getting more pages of information, you may be required credits in your Shodan account.

This is a team project. I also put our final poster into the repository.
